Due to active galaxy nuclei (AGN) mechanism at the center of the galaxies, electronics are ejected to blow and push the gas around. Bubbles or cavities are then generated, which can be detected at the X-ray band. 
Since AGN reveals quite lots of attracting physical phenomenons, detecting of them is significant. However, there exist many difficulties disturbing our works. For instance, the background and system noise in the X-ray images, which lead to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), should be eliminated. In addition, the high brightness (temperature) in the galaxy center usually leads to low contrast of the ROI compared to other regions.
